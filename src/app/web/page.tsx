                        to me to make his website. Since he&apos;s gotten it, he&apos;s earned playing opportunities around the country and experienced a surge in
                        students in his studio. The website uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Next.js, and uses both external APIs for email service, and browser APIs for much of the functionality.

                    <p className="w-1/2 text-center mx-auto my-4">Gig-Econ has been a pet project to help me in my efforts as an often gigging musician, photographer, and waiter. Very often, you need to count large sums of cash quickly.
                        I found it easier to just count the number of bills and calculate them by hand. However, this often lead to me forgetting my totals and it was often just a hassle
                        to do by hand. So I made gig-econ to act as a quick calculator, and then added functionality to record my transactions and date them. This project uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Next.js,
                        a NoSQL database (MonogDB), and uses APIs for Authentication. It also uses a UI library, DaisyUI, though a rework is currently in progress. The application is also a PWA app, installable
                        on both Android and Apple devices through most browsers.

                        to the project as a photographer and created the current homepage for the project. The client is very ambitious and very good at marketing. Our push goal is to add a sidescrolling game that&apos;s currently in development and a blog.
                        We&apos;re currently investigating CMS options for the client to add blogposts through a friendly UI. The project features HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Next.js, and Tailwind.
